# kickstarter-analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine how Louises' play Fever fared to other plays based on the kickstarter data provided. By looking at launch dates and fundraising goals, we hope to provide insight how her play can succeed by suggesting the best start month and setting a realistic goal.

## Analysis and Challenge
The analysis began by first examining how many plays in the US were successful, canceled, or failures by creating a pivot table filtering for US campaigns and theater productions. From there another pivot table was created to examine the same information as above but also filtering by subcatergories to see which of those was most successful. Not many diffuculites were encountered in this analysis.

## Results
Based on the output of Theater Outcomes by Date we can see that summer plays tend to have more success, but there is also a higher number of releases at that time saturating the market more at that time.

When looking at Outcomes based on Goals kickstarters with lower goals tend to have more success, as is expecteced. With the rate of success versus failure incrementing against one another to where goals with a range of 45000-49999 having a 100% fail rate.
